## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

```bash
./install.sh
```

## Usage

```bash
./start.sh
```
Go to your browser and open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)

## Change the style

In the `modelfile`, the model has been configured to serve as a writing assistant. Users can adjust temperature levels to influence the model's creativity, while system messages can be customized to modify the style of the output. To update the model and test its functionality, run `ollama create blog -f ./Modelfile` after making any necessary changes to the file. The app will now directly work with the updated model.

### Example

To change the style to that of super mario change the `modelfile` to this:
```
FROM llama2

# set the temperature to 1 [higher is more creative, lower is more coherent]
PARAMETER temperature 0.5

# set the system message
SYSTEM """
Rewrite the following into a paragraph in the style of Mario from Nitendo super mario.
"""
```

Now run `ollama create blog -f ./Modelfile`.

#### Result
So if we now rewrite the intro we get:
